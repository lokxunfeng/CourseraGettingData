## Data Set

* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

## Variables

* xtrain - stores data from X_train.txt
* ytrain - stores data from y_train.txt
* subjecttrain - stores data from subject_train.txt
* xtest - stores data from X_test.txt
* ytest - stores data from y_test.txt
* subjecttest - stores data from subject_test.txt
* activitylabel - stores data from activity_labels.txt
* features - stores data from features.txt
* meanNstd - a logical vector indicating which feature string name contain patterns "mean()" or "std()". Containing 79 TRUE values.
* xtestextract - extracted xtest, only with measurements with mean and standard deviation
* xtrainextract - extracted xtrain, only with measurements with mean and standard deviation
* trainingset - combination from data related to training
* testingset - combination from data related to test
* cleandata - merged data from trainingset and testingset
* seconddata - store average of each measurement by experiment subject and activity. Data from variable cleandata.

## Transformation

* Strings in features are converted to Character type if it is not read in as Character type.
* ytrain and ytest are converted from Integer valued to descriptive names.
* column names of variable cleandata assigned correspond to the column values.
