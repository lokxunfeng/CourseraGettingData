CourseraGettingData
===================
Extract the data into a folder and download run_analysis.R into the same folder.
Source run_analysis.R in R.
The programme will read in data sets and merge them together to produce a data extract 
consisting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation, named "cleandata".

In the end of programme, the programme will produce MeanBySubjectNActivity.txt
which gives the average of measurement in "cleandata" by experiment subject and by experiment activities.
